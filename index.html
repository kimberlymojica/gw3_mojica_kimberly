        <p> In November 2019, Warner Bros. Television developed a Friends Reunion Special for their new streaming service, HBO Max. The special would feature the whole cast and most co-stars. In February 2020, an unscripted Friends was comissioned with all the original cast and co-creators reuniting
        <br/>
        The show's co-creators Kevin S. Bright, Marta Kauffman and David Crane became the special's executive producers. The show's main cast Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer also had a hand in production. Warner Brothers Unscripted & Alternative Television (later Warner Horizon Unscripted Television) was also involved in the production of the special.
        <br/>
        The special was filmed in Los Angeles, California at Stage 24, also known as "The Friends Stage" at Warner Brothers Studios, Burbank, where Friends had been filmed since it's second season. The filming of the reunion began in April 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic caused two seperate delays for filming the special. Once in March, 2020 and another in August, 2020.

        While many fans of Friends were hoping the reunion would be an episode showing a glimpse at where the beloved characters and their families are at nowadays. Fans were hoping to see how the children were like now that they would be older. Would Ben and Emma be friends with the triplets and the Bing twins Jack and Erica? Unfortunately this wasn't the case with the reunion. Instead the reunion special was more of a tell-all where cast reminicesed their time on the show, talking about favorite scenes and moments with the cast. Special guests made appearances throughout the reunion as well. Tom Selleck came back to talk about his time as Richard but beloved Mike Hannigan (played by Paul Rudd) was missed by fans when he never appeared throughout the special. There were a handful of celebrities that never appeared on the show as well. Lady Gaga, Justin Beiber, BTS, and Cara Delevingne were a few who popped in throughout the reunion.</p>

        <h2>Jennifer Aniston opens up about her experience on set</h2>
        <img src="images/aniston.jpg" alt= "Jennifer Anitson">

        <p>"It's nostalgic in a way that's kind of also a little melancholy, you know, 'cause a lot has changed. We have all gone down different roads... Some easy and some not-so easy for each of us."
        <br/>
        The whole cast was ready to go and full of spirit waiting to return to Stage 24 and film the reunion for a show that changed all of their lives and hearts. Jennifer admitted that is was like a "sucker punch" to their hearts returning to set. Not only did their return to set bring happy memories from making the show, but it brought a bubbling of emotion from how different their lives used to be. Jennifer realized on set that their lives used to be so much simpler back then. Since the show ended, life moved on and times got harder. The cast went through marriages, divorces, births, miscarriages, losses, and changes.
        <br/>
        When Friends wrapped up, she was still married to Brad Pitt. Then, ten years later, she married Justin Theroux but split in 2017. These are things the young, bright-eyed actress never would have imagined life going for her during the filming of the show. While she has gone through heartache, after Friends ended she found success in various other movies such as Marley &amp; Me, He's Just Not That Into You, and The Switch.
