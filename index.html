        <p> In November 2019, Warner Bros. Television developed a Friends Reunion Special for their new streaming service, HBO Max. The special would feature the whole cast and most co-stars. In February 2020, an unscripted Friends was comissioned with all the original cast and co-creators reuniting. </p>

        <p>The show's co-creators Kevin S. Bright, Marta Kauffman and David Crane became the special's executive producers. The show's main cast Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer also had a hand in production. Warner Brothers Unscripted & Alternative Television (later Warner Horizon Unscripted Television) was also involved in the production of the special.</p>

        <p>The special was filmed in Los Angeles, California at Stage 24, also known as "The Friends Stage" at Warner Brothers Studios, Burbank, where Friends had been filmed since it's second season. The filming of the reunion began in April 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic caused two seperate delays for filming the special. Once in March, 2020 and another in August, 2020.</p>

        <p>"It's nostalgic in a way that's kind of also a little melancjoly, you know, 'cause a lot has changed. We have all gone down different roads... Some easy and some not-so easy for each of us."</p>
